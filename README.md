This is the repository for the first (and second) edition of the book "Statistical Learning in Genetics: An Introduction Using R". It has two folders: Codes and ErrataNotes. The folder Codes contains most of the R-codes used in the book. These R-codes are labelled using four digits. The first two digits refer to the chapter in the book; the next two refer to the actual order in which the R-code appears in the book. For example, code0103.R is the third R-code in chapter 1. The labels of the R-codes in the folder Codes coincide with the labels of the R-codes used in the book.  

  The folder ErrataNotes contains errata and notes. The errata and modifications for the first edition are collected in a single pdf file that will be updated regularly: errata.pdf. The corresponding file for the second edition is errata2.pdf.
  
  The notes in folder ErrataNotes are pdf files with comments, clarifications or additions of themes discussed in the book. The notes are labelled after chapter (first two digits) and after their chronological order of creation (second two digits). For example, note0402.pdf is the second note related to a subject discussed in chapter 4.
