This repository has two folders: Codes and ErrataNotes. The folder Codes contains most of the R-codes used in the book. These R-codes are labelled using four digits. The first two digits refer to the chapter in the book, and the next two refer to the actual order in whch the R-code appears in the book. For example, code0103.R, is the third R-code in chapter 1. The labels of the R-codes in the folder Codes coincide with the labels of the R-codes used in the book.  

  The folder ErrataNotes contains errata and notes. The errata are pdf files named after chapter (first two digits), and after their order of discovery (second two digits), starting with the first reported error. For example, errata0302.pdf, is the second reported error (in terms of time of discovery) that belongs in chapter 3. 
  
  The notes in folder ErrataNotes are pdf files with comments, clarifications or additions of themes discussed in the book. The notes are labelled after chapter (first two digits), and after their order of creation (second two digits). For example, note0402.pdf is the second note related to a subject discussed in chapter 4.
